The loginValidator Project works in the following steps

1) The user is brought to the login.html page with a space for entering username and password.
The user enters the username and password which are 'admin' and 'password'.

2) The login is taken in by the loginValidator.java file and the username and password are validated

3) If the login is correct, the user is brought to the dashboard page which welcomes the user 
and gives a button for logging out.

4) If the login is incorrect, the user is brought back to the login page with a red error message
saying the login was unsuccessful and prompts the user to try again

5) When logging out, the logout.java servlet invalidates the session that the user was in and then 
redirects the user back to the login.html page
